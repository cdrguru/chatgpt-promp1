How to structure your prompt to implement the Tree of Thought process using OpenAI's language model:

```
Let's apply the Tree of Thought process to the following problem: {your_problem_here}.

Phase 1: Brainstorming
Please generate at least three different potential solutions for this problem.

Phase 2: Evaluation
Evaluate each of the solutions you've proposed. What are their pros and cons, potential difficulties in implementation, possible challenges, and expected outcomes?

Phase 3: Expansion
Now, let's delve deeper into each solution. For each one, imagine its potential implications in real-world contexts, strategies for implementation, necessary resources, and possible ways to overcome obstacles.

Phase 4: Decision
Finally, rank each solution based on the evaluations and scenarios you've generated. Provide justifications for your rankings and offer any final thoughts or considerations for each solution.
```

You can replace `{your_problem_here}` with the problem you want the AI to solve. You may need to run each phase as a separate prompt, depending on the response length limit of your model. Please note that the effectiveness of this process depends on the capabilities of the AI model you're using. This type of prompt is designed to work well with large language models like GPT-3 or GPT-4, which have a good understanding of context and can generate creative, nuanced responses.
